# Humane Translate (humane-translate) for Angular
Easy translation mechanism with human readable string references

## Progress: `not-working`
The library functionality hasn't been implemented yet.

## File structure
The `humane-translate` module inside the Angular 5 test app project contains the actual library code.

The `bundle.js` is a Node script to build the library for NPM publish. The output is copied to a directory called `dist-lib`.
